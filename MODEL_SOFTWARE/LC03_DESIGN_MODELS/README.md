# LC03_DESIGN_MODELS

**Lifecycle Phase:** Design Models

## Purpose

This directory contains software for architecture modeling, SysML/MBSE tools, design baseline generators, and interface modeling utilities.

## Contents

Software artifacts in this directory include:
- Architecture modeling tools
- SysML/MBSE software and utilities
- Design baseline generators
- Interface modeling tools
- Design documentation generators
- Model transformation utilities

## Naming Convention

All software artifacts follow the **v6.0 nomenclature standard** with:
- `MODEL=SW` token
- `PHASE=LC03` token
- `KNOT` binding (typically K03 for design)
- Full compliance with controlled vocabulary (Section 10.2 of main README)

## Usage

Place software here when it:
- Supports system architecture development
- Implements MBSE workflows
- Generates design artifacts
- Manages interface definitions
- Supports design baseline control
