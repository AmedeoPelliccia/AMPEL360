# LC04_ENGINEERING_ANALYSIS_AND_CALCULATION_MODELS

**Lifecycle Phase:** Engineering Analysis & Calculation Models

## Purpose

This directory contains software for engineering analyses, calculation engines, trade studies, margin calculators, and model validation utilities.

## Contents

Software artifacts in this directory include:
- Analysis software and calculation engines
- Trade study tools and frameworks
- Margin calculators and budget tools
- Model validation utilities
- Simulation wrappers and drivers
- Performance analysis tools

## Naming Convention

All software artifacts follow the **v6.0 nomenclature standard** with:
- `MODEL=SW` token
- `PHASE=LC04` token
- `KNOT` binding (typically K04 for analysis)
- Full compliance with controlled vocabulary (Section 10.2 of main README)

## Usage

Place software here when it:
- Performs engineering calculations
- Conducts trade studies
- Validates design models
- Analyzes system performance
- Manages engineering margins
