# LC01_PROBLEM_STATEMENT_GENERATION_PROMPTING_ENGINEERING

**Lifecycle Phase:** Problem Statement / Generation / Prompting Engineering

## Purpose

This directory contains software for problem framing, ideation, NKU (Named Knowledge Unit) generation pathways, prompting engineering baselines, and initial scope statement generators.

## Contents

Software artifacts in this directory include:
- Problem framing and analysis tools
- Ideation and brainstorming software
- NKU generation engines and pathways
- Prompting engineering frameworks and baselines
- Initial scope statement generators
- Requirements elicitation tools

## Naming Convention

All software artifacts follow the **v6.0 nomenclature standard** with:
- `MODEL=SW` token
- `PHASE=LC01` token
- `KNOT` binding (typically K01 for problem statement generation)
- Full compliance with controlled vocabulary (Section 10.2 of main README)

## Usage

Place software here when it:
- Supports problem definition and scoping
- Generates or manages knowledge units
- Implements prompting engineering patterns
- Facilitates requirements discovery
- Supports early-phase conceptual work
