# LC10_INDUSTRIALIZATION_SERIALIZATION_PRODUCTION_PLAN_CM

**Lifecycle Phase:** Industrialization / Serialization / Production Plan / CM

## Purpose

This directory contains software for industrial planning, production readiness tools, configuration baseline managers, and manufacturing interface utilities.

## Contents

Software artifacts in this directory include:
- Industrial planning software
- Production readiness tools
- Configuration baseline managers
- Manufacturing interface utilities
- Serialization tracking tools
- Production workflow automation
- Build-of-materials generators

## Naming Convention

All software artifacts follow the **v6.0 nomenclature standard** with:
- `MODEL=SW` token
- `PHASE=LC10` token
- `KNOT` binding (typically K10 for industrialization)
- Full compliance with controlled vocabulary (Section 10.2 of main README)

## Usage

Place software here when it:
- Supports production planning
- Manages configuration baselines
- Tracks serialization
- Interfaces with manufacturing systems
- Automates production workflows
