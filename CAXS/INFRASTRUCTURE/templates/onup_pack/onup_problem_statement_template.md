# Node Problem Statement — {{AXIS}} / ATA {{ATA}} / BLOCK {{BLOCK}} / {{PHASE}}

## 1. Context
Describe why this node exists, what it controls, and its boundary conditions.

## 2. Uncertainty statement (normative)
Define the uncertainty as testable claims:
- U1: {{UNCERTAINTY_1}}
- U2: {{UNCERTAINTY_2}}

## 3. Hypotheses / candidate resolutions
H1: {{HYPOTHESIS_1}}  
H2: {{HYPOTHESIS_2}}  
H3: {{HYPOTHESIS_3}}

## 4. Acceptance criteria (collapse criteria)
A node may be considered "collapsed" only when:
- C1: {{CRITERION_1}} (measurable)
- C2: {{CRITERION_2}} (measurable)
- C3: {{CRITERION_3}} (measurable)

## 5. Method of Compliance / Evidence acceptability (pointer)
Reference MoC mapping rules and evidence acceptability basis:
- MoC basis link: {{MOC_BASIS_LINK}}
- Evidence rules link: {{EVIDENCE_RULES_LINK}}

## 6. Impact / entanglement summary
Summarize cross-ATA impacts; the authoritative list is the impact matrix CSV.
- Highest-severity coupling: {{TOP_COUPLING}}
- Safety/security triggers: {{SAFETY_SECURITY_TRIGGERS}}

## 7. Planned resolution approach (pathways P01–P05)
- P01: {{P01_PLAN}}
- P02: {{P02_PLAN}}
- P03: {{P03_PLAN}}
- P04: {{P04_PLAN}}
- P05: {{P05_PLAN}}

## 8. Required signoffs (if any)
If closure requires SIGNOFF:
- Signoff required: {{SIGNOFF_REQUIRED}} (true/false)
- Signoff authority AoR: {{SIGNOFF_AOR}} (must be STK_CM or STK_CERT)
- Decision artifact target: {{SIGNOFF_TARGET_LINK}}
