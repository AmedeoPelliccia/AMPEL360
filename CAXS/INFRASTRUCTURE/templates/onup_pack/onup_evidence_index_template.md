# Evidence Index — {{AXIS}} / ATA {{ATA}} / BLOCK {{BLOCK}} / {{PHASE}}

## Intent
Catalog all evidence artifacts required/produced for this node. Evidence must be traceable to tasks and acceptance criteria.

## Evidence catalog
| Evidence ID | Evidence Type | Purpose | Produced By Task | Status | Link |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| E-001 | RPT/LOG/CASE | {{PURPOSE}} | Kxx-T### | DRAFT/ACTIVE/RELEASED | {{LINK}} |
| E-002 | RPT/LOG/CASE | {{PURPOSE}} | Kxx-T### | DRAFT/ACTIVE/RELEASED | {{LINK}} |

## Evidence completeness checklist
- [ ] All tasks referencing `required_evidence` have corresponding entries here
- [ ] Evidence artifacts are v6.0 canonical (in-scope)
- [ ] Evidence links resolve (link integrity gate)
- [ ] Where required, evidence is included in an evidence pack manifest
