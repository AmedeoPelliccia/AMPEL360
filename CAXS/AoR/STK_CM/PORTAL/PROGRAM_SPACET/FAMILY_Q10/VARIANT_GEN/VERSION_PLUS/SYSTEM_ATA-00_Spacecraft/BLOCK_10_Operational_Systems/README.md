## Purpose

Block 10 governs **operational-system CM** at program level: how operational baselines, readiness artifacts,
and controlled releases are managed and evidenced.

This block primarily touches:
- **K02** (ConOps / mission-operations / command authority)
- **K09** (ground/spaceport interfaces / service readiness)
- **K11** (procedures / training / readiness gates)
- **K13** (cybersecurity zones / key management / secure operations)
- **K14** (sustainment / reliability / maintenance feedback loops)

Supporting governance may reference:
- **K04** (interfaces / integration contracts)
- **K06** (data governance / SSOT / schemas / identifiers)
- **K08** (evidence packaging & release snapshots)

## Navigation (folders)

- [MODEL_PROCESS/](./MODEL_PROCESS/) — governance artifacts, registers, signoffs, evidence
- [MODEL_SOFTWARE/](./MODEL_SOFTWARE/) — enforcement tooling/configuration (if used in this block)
