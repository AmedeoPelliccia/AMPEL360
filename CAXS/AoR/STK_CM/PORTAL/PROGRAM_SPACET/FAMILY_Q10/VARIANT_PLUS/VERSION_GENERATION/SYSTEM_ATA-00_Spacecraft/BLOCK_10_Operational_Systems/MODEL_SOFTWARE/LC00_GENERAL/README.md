# LC00 — General (MODEL=SW)

**Portal Context:** CAXS → AoR → STK_CM → PORTAL → PROGRAM_SPACET → FAMILY_Q10 → VARIANT_PLUS → VERSION_GENERATION  
**System Context:** SYSTEM_ATA-00_Spacecraft → BLOCK_10_Operational_Systems  
**Lifecycle:** LC00_GENERAL  
**Primary Owner (AoR):** STK_CM  
**Status:** Active (Portal Baseline)

---

## 1. Purpose

This directory contains **general-purpose software assets** that support the Space-T portal’s
**MODEL_SOFTWARE** stack for this system/block, including:

- shared libraries and utilities reused across lifecycle phases (LC01–LC14),
- common schemas, controlled vocabularies, and ID services,
- portal integration adapters (routing, permissions, audit logging),
- baseline tooling for indexing, packaging, and export scaffolding,
- cross-cutting validation and CI helpers.

LC00 is the **foundation layer**: anything software-related that is **not phase-specific** belongs here.

---

## 2. Scope (What belongs here)

Typical LC00 software artifacts include:

### 2.1 Shared foundations
- common Python/JS libraries used by LC01–LCxx tools,
- shared CLI frameworks and configuration loaders,
- reusable components for deterministic builds.

### 2.2 Governance enablers (software)
- nomenclature validators and token parsers,
- controlled vocabulary checkers and dictionary loaders,
- ID generators/resolvers (stable IDs, link resolvers).

### 2.3 Portal integration & orchestration
- AoR-aware routing logic and policy gates (software side),
- audit logging utilities (hashes, provenance stamps),
- connectors to registers/indexes (read/write APIs, file emitters).

### 2.4 Common schemas & registries (as software inputs)
- JSON/YAML schemas used across phases,
- small registry compilers or schema-to-doc generators.

### 2.5 CI helpers
- GitHub Actions helpers, lint wrappers, test runners,
- shared checklists or report generators emitted by CI.

---

## 3. Out of scope (Do NOT place here)

- Phase-specific tooling (place in the relevant LCxx directory)
- Non-software governance signoffs/approvals (K01 governance folders)
- Large datasets or bulky generated outputs
- Final published baselines (export/release locations)

---

## 4. Minimum expected capabilities (baseline)

LC00 should enable the following for the entire MODEL_SOFTWARE stack:

1) **Configuration Loader** (single canonical config model for tools)  
2) **Nomenclature / Vocabulary Validator** (v6.0 enforcement in CI)  
3) **Stable ID + Trace Helpers** (shared primitives for link integrity)  
4) **Common Schemas** (prompt/requirement/model/evidence record shapes)  
5) **Packaging/Export Scaffolding** (consistent artifact packaging patterns)  

---

## 5. Recommended sub-structure (tooling lanes)

Use these subfolders if/when needed:

- `LIB/` — shared libraries, reusable modules
- `SCHEMAS/` — cross-phase JSON/YAML schemas (canonical record shapes)
- `VOCAB/` — controlled vocabulary dictionaries + loaders
- `IDS/` — ID generation, resolution, linking utilities
- `PORTAL/` — AoR routing, policy gates, audit/provenance utilities
- `CI/` — shared CI wrappers, reporters, pipeline helpers
- `EXPORT/` — common packaging, manifest emitters, bundle builders
- `FIXTURES/` — minimal deterministic fixtures for unit tests

If `00_INDEX.md` is auto-generated by CGen, do not edit it manually.

---

## 6. Interfaces (LC00 I/O)

**Inputs**
- portal configuration (AoR policies, allowed tools, gate rules)
- controlled vocabularies and naming standards (v6.0 tokens)
- cross-phase schema requirements

**Outputs**
- reusable libraries consumed by LC01–LCxx tooling
- consistent validation results and CI reports
- deterministic packaging/export helpers for downstream release processes

---

## 7. MoSCoW feature definition (LC00 foundation for the portal)

### Must have
- **Common Config + Logging** (uniform behavior across tools)
- **Nomenclature + Vocabulary Gate** (CI enforcement, actionable errors)
- **Stable ID & Link Resolver** (trace integrity across lifecycle)
- **Schema Registry** (canonical record formats shared across phases)
- **Audit/Provenance Utility** (hashing, run manifests, tool version stamping)

### Should have
- **Unified CLI Patterns** (consistent flags, help, exit codes)
- **Report Emitters** (JSON/MD summaries for PRs and dashboards)
- **Deterministic Build Helpers** (pinned deps, reproducible outputs)

### Could have
- **Portal SDK** (starter kit for adding new phase tools quickly)
- **Policy-as-Code Plugins** (extensible gate rules per AoR/system)

### Won’t have (in this folder)
- Non-software approvals/signoffs (K01)
- Phase-specific engines (LC01/LC02/LC03…)
- Published baselines (release/export dirs)

---

## 8. Naming & compliance

All artifacts must follow the repository **v6.0 nomenclature** and controlled vocabulary rules.

Minimum enforcement:
- `MODEL=SW`
- `PHASE=LC00`
- correct bindings for `SYSTEM`, `BLOCK`, `AoR`.

LC00 utilities are expected to be referenced by other phases; maintain backwards compatibility where feasible and version interfaces explicitly when breaking changes are required.

---

## 9. Review & change control

- Any LC00 change is potentially cross-cutting; require:
  - PR with clear impact note,
  - unit tests and/or fixture-based validation,
  - confirmation that downstream LCxx tools still pass gates,
  - registry updates if schemas or ID rules change.

STK_CM maintains configuration control and ensures LC00 remains stable, reproducible, and portal-consistent.
