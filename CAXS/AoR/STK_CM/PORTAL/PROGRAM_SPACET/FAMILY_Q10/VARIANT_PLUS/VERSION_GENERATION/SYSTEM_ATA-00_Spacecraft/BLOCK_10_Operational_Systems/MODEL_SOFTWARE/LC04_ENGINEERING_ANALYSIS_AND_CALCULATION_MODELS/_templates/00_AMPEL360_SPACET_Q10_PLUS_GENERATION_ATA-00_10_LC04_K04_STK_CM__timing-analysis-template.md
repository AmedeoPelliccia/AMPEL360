# Timing Analysis — Template (LC04)

## Artifact Metadata
- PROGRAM/FAMILY/VARIANT/VERSION: SPACET / Q10 / PLUS / GEN
- SYSTEM/BLOCK/MODEL/LC: ATA00 / B10 / SW / LC04
- ARTIFACT_TYPE / ARTIFACT_ID / VTAG: TIMING / <ID> / v1.0
- Owner AoR: STK_CM
- KNOT binding: K<01..14>

## 1. Objective
Define what timing property is being analyzed (latency, WCET envelope, scheduling feasibility).

## 2. Assumptions
- Clock rate, core count, OS scheduling policy
- Input loads, worst-case triggers
- Toolchain and measurement approach

## 3. Method
- Model or measurement strategy
- Steps to reproduce
- Inputs and configs

## 4. Results
- Key tables/plots
- Envelope compliance vs requirements

## 5. Conclusions / Actions
- Pass/fail statements
- Impacted AoRs / revalidation triggers
