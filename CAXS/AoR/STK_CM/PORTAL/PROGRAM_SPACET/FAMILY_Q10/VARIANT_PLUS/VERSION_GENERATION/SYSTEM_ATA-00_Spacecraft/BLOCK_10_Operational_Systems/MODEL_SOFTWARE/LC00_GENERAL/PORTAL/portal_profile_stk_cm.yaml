  # CM Operational Objectives
  objectives:
    - "Maintain baselines reproducible (truth at each version)"
    - "Control change (what, why, who approves, what to revalidate)"
    - "Ensure integrity (nomenclature/vocab, links/trace, registries)"
    - "Produce evidence/export packages (release bundles, manifests, hashes)"

  # Apps Enabled for CM Portal
  # Must-have apps (CM core) + Should-have apps (CM efficiency)
  apps_enabled:
    # Must-have: CM Core
    - baseline_manager           # create/update baseline manifests, freeze points
    - change_control_console     # view collectors, gate results, PR checklist
    - diff_impact_analyzer       # change set → impacted AoRs/KNOTs/LC
    - trace_graph_explorer       # Req↔Model↔Evidence↔Export integrity
    - registry_console           # IDs, duplicates, versions, owners, states
    - release_export_packager    # build bundles: manifest + hashes + evidence
    - audit_log_viewer           # run manifests, tool versions, sha256, provenance
    
    # Should-have: CM Efficiency
    - ci_results_dashboard       # CI workflow results visualization
    - vocabulary_nomenclature_ui # view violations by PR and by area
    - coupling_risk_viewer       # coupling analysis visualization
    - artifact_catalog_search    # search by v6.0 tokens
