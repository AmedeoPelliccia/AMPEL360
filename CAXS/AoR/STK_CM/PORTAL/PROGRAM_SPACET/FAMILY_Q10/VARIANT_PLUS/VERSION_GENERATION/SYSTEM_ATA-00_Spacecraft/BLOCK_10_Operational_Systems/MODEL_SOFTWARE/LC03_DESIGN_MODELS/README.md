# LC03 — Design Models (MODEL=SW)

**Portal Context:** CAXS → AoR → STK_CM → PORTAL → PROGRAM_SPACET → FAMILY_Q10 → VARIANT_PLUS → VERSION_GENERATION  
**System Context:** SYSTEM_ATA-00_Spacecraft → BLOCK_10_Operational_Systems  
**Lifecycle:** LC03_DESIGN_MODELS  
**Primary Owner (AoR):** STK_CM  
**Status:** Active (Portal Baseline)

---

## 1. Purpose

This directory contains **software artifacts** that support the creation, management, validation, and export of
**design models** for Space-T in the portal context, including:

- MBSE/SysML model automation (structure, behavior, interfaces),
- architecture baselining and configuration control for models,
- interface model generation (ICD scaffolds, ports, signals),
- model-to-model and model-to-document transformations,
- portal-grade governance for reproducible design model outputs.

This is **MODEL_SOFTWARE**: tooling and automation that *produces or validates* LC03 design models.

---

## 2. Scope (What belongs here)

Store here software that performs any of the following LC03 functions:

### 2.1 Architecture modeling & MBSE automation
- SysML/UML model generators and updaters (blocks, activities, state machines),
- architecture skeleton generators (system decomposition, packages),
- requirement-to-model synchronization tools.

### 2.2 Interface modeling & ICD scaffolding
- port/signal dictionary compilers,
- interface requirement extractors and ICD draft generators,
- cross-ATA dependency modelers (coupling graph integration).

### 2.3 Model transformations & exports
- SysML ↔ JSON/YAML interchange converters,
- model-to-doc generators (design summaries, interface lists),
- exporters to downstream analysis tools (CAE inputs, simulation configs).

### 2.4 Model validation & quality gates
- model linting (naming rules, package structure, stereotype usage),
- consistency checks (unconnected ports, orphan functions, invalid links),
- traceability checks (model elements ↔ requirements ↔ knots).

### 2.5 Baseline control & comparison
- model diff tooling (structural diffs, semantic diffs),
- baseline snapshots and reproducibility tooling,
- build pipelines for “known-good” architecture baselines.

---

## 3. Out of scope (Do NOT place here)

- The design models themselves (unless they are small tool fixtures)
- Large binary model artifacts without an accompanying reproducible pipeline
- Formal approvals/signoffs (K01 governance folders)
- Published baselines (export to controlled release/export locations)

This folder should contain the **software** that generates/validates models, not the authoritative model repositories.

---

## 4. Minimum expected capabilities (baseline)

This LC03 tooling must support, at minimum:

1) **Model Baseline Generator** (repeatable, versioned architecture skeleton)  
2) **Interface Scaffolding Tooling** (ports/signals/ICD candidates)  
3) **Model Quality Gate** (lint + structural integrity checks in CI)  
4) **Traceability Binding** (model elements ↔ LC02 requirements ↔ KNOT tasks)  

---

## 5. Recommended sub-structure (tooling lanes)

Use these subfolders if/when needed:

- `MBSE/` — SysML/UML generators, package skeleton builders, sync engines
- `INTERFACES/` — ICD scaffolding, port/signal dictionary compilers
- `TRANSFORMS/` — converters (SysML↔JSON/YAML), model-to-doc pipelines
- `VALIDATORS/` — model linting, consistency checks, trace checks
- `BASELINES/` — snapshot tooling, diff engines, reproducibility pipelines
- `EXPORT/` — exporters to CAE/simulation configs and downstream tools
- `CI/` — LC03 gates and workflow helpers
- `FIXTURES/` — small deterministic test fixtures

If `00_INDEX.md` is auto-generated by CGen, do not edit it manually.

---

## 6. Interfaces (LC03 I/O)

**Upstream inputs**
- LC02 requirement records and trace bindings (normalized)
- coupling constraints (cross-ATA dependencies / ICD requirements)
- portal policies (AoR gates, allowable tools, naming rules)

**Downstream outputs**
- LC04: analysis model inputs (simulation configs, parameter sets)
- LC05/LC06: integration and verification model scaffolds (test harness configs)
- Portal: architecture baseline packages, model diffs, interface registers
- AoR review: interface impact packets and baseline change summaries

---

## 7. MoSCoW feature definition (Portal LC03 launchpad)

### Must have
- **Architecture Skeleton Generator** (repeatable packages/decomposition)
- **Interface Scaffolding** (ports/signals + ICD candidate generation)
- **Model Quality Gate** (structure/lint rules enforced in CI)
- **Traceability Binding** (model elements ↔ requirements ↔ knots)
- **Baseline Diff + Impact** (what changed, which interfaces/reqs are affected)

### Should have
- **Model-to-Doc Exports** (design summaries, interface tables, change logs)
- **Cross-ATA Coupling Integration** (dependency graph awareness in model)
- **Deterministic Build Mode** (reproducible baselines from inputs)

### Could have
- **Interactive Model Workbench UI** in portal (guardrails + audit logs)
- **Automated Refactoring Suggestions** (anti-duplication, pattern guidance)
- **Multi-tool Bridges** (SysML tool adapters: Cameo, Capella, etc.)

### Won’t have (in this folder)
- Authority approvals and certification signoffs (K01)
- Final published baselines (release/export directories)

---

## 8. Naming & compliance

All artifacts must follow the repository **v6.0 nomenclature** and controlled vocabulary rules.

Minimum enforcement:
- `MODEL=SW`
- `PHASE=LC03`
- correct bindings for `SYSTEM`, `BLOCK`, `KNOT`, `AoR`.

Tool outputs must carry:
- stable IDs for model elements,
- trace hooks to LC02 requirement IDs and KNOT tasks,
- deterministic export behavior where feasible.

---

## 9. Review & change control

- Changes to LC03 engines/validators/transforms require:
  - PR diff summary,
  - model gate execution (lint + consistency + trace checks),
  - baseline regeneration if generators or ID rules change,
  - update of registries if interfaces/exports are affected.

STK_CM maintains configuration control and ensures LC03 remains reproducible and portal-consistent.
