**Owner (AoR):** STK_CM

---

## Purpose

This folder contains **approval artifacts** for the program **authority model** and the **decision-rights
structure** governed under K01.

---

## Scope

- Authority model approval documents (signed statements / approvals)
- Decision-rights matrices (if governed as signoff artifacts rather than SSOT registers)
- Governance approval records (minutes, decision records)
- Delegation-of-authority approvals (delegated decision rights, delegated signatory authority)

---

## Usage

Place all authority model approval artifacts in this directory following the **nomenclature v6.0**.

### Recommended filename pattern (approval artifacts)

`00_AMPEL360_SPACET_Q10_PLUS_GENERATION_PR_00_<LC>_K01_STK_CM__<AuthorityRef>_SIGNOFF_APPROVAL_<Ixx-Ryy>_<STATUS>.<ext>`

Examples:
- `00_AMPEL360_SPACET_Q10_PLUS_GENERATION_PR_00_LC01_K01_STK_CM__Authority_Model_v1_SIGNOFF_APPROVAL_I01-R01_ACTIVE.pdf`
- `00_AMPEL360_SPACET_Q10_PLUS_GENERATION_PR_00_LC01_K01_STK_CM__Decision_Rights_Matrix_SIGNOFF_APPROVAL_I01-R01_ACTIVE.md`
- `00_AMPEL360_SPACET_Q10_PLUS_GENERATION_PR_00_LC01_K01_STK_CM__Delegation_Authority_STK_CM_SIGNOFF_APPROVAL_I01-R01_ACTIVE.pdf`

### Minimal content expectations (suggested)

- Authority model / decision-rights reference (version, baseline or snapshot ID if applicable)
- Decision scope (what is approved and what is excluded)
- Approval context (board/committee, meeting reference)
- Approver(s): role/AoR, date/time, signature method
- Delegation details (if applicable): delegator, delegate, limits, validity period
- Links to SSOT registers (if decision rights are maintained as registers)

---

## Cross-reference (SSOT)

Each approval artifact should be logged in:
- `MODEL_PROCESS/REGISTRY/SIGNOFF_REGISTER/` (structured signoff record linking to this artifact)

Where applicable, reference:
- `MODEL_PROCESS/REGISTRY/APPROVAL_MATRIX/` (if maintained as SSOT)
- `MODEL_PROCESS/REGISTRY/ICD_CATALOG/` (if authority affects interface governance)
